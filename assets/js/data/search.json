After all, that’s the definition of talent, isn’t it?– However, it sounds to me like a pretty good excuse to not try too hard. One of the reasons is that we constantly compare ourselves to other people around us. Everyone had to start somewhere. Nobody became a great designer overnight. However, we don’t usually see the progress and the entire journey. We notice great people once they’re at the top. Don’t use “I have no talent” as an excuse. Why it is Hard to Design for Yourself and How to Overcome it Designing for yourself can be hard, but with the right strategy, it can a whole lot easier.I was there for a long time. Never quite settled on my own style. Always experimenting, changing things and ‘unsure of myself’ visually. I was always wondering if it was good enough, or if it properly represented me and my talents. As if somehow one design should sum up everything about me and all I was capable of. I was putting way too much pressure on it. You Are Less Forgiving of Your Own Work You Want to Say too much in One Thing You Skip Steps of the Design Process. You Want to Encapsulate Yourself You Change Your Mind way to Often. You are too Hard on Yourself. You Don’t Have Anyone to get Feedback From. You Don’t Define the Deeper Meaning You Don’t Have Enough Constraints. HOW TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLES OF DESIGNING FOR YOURSELF You need to set a Clear and In-depth Process Set Boundaries Be Clear On the Purpose Get Accountability You can Do it! Feeling Stuck? Design What You Don’t Know Where is it?! It has to be here somewhere. It use to be so easy. What happened? Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere. That idea is somewhere. It’s here, it has to be. This is where I’ve always found it. But there’s nothing. The only shapes I find here are well worn and boring, dints still obvious even with fresh paint. Oh so boring. So boring and so often used because they’re just “fine.” Too easily used. Too easily reached for and offered up as if they were new again. " } ]
