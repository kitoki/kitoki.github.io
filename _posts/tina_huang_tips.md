title: tips to learn technical things faster

do you read things over and over again  
do you spend most of your time taking notes  
do you actually read textbooks  

- active recall
- environment design (book atomic habit also mention this)
- rotating between focus and rest
- interleaving (learn multiple thing on same day different topic)
  - dont switch too often, timely, like, 2 or 3 hour in between, multitasking is bad
  - dont use this when you still at beginning, its not benefit much
  - summarizing in form QA
- priming (taking glance before actually learning)
  - if possible make it more enjoyable, such as, find multiple article that related with this topic, find multiple way to explore, check wikipedia outline, a way to get you motivated, find research with similar subject, project based,
  - find a way more engaging
