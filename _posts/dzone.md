- define the terms
- advantage
- disadvantage


- expensive technologies if they are implemented with high standards
-- therefore, they should be used only in cases where we it is difficult to do without them or when there are sufficiently high risks
-- ex: event where we need continuous user identification

- additional functionality better to pay attention :
-- does the solution allow continuous authentication?
-- is there integration with other solutions?
-- how is role-based access performed?
